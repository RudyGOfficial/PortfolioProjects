# Python & Jupyter Notebook Amazon Web Scraping Project
This project demonstrates how to use Python & Jupyter Notebook to scrape Amazon for datapoints, and use them to create/update CSVs & DataFrames. This script works for Windows only.

## This Project Demonstrates the Following Python & Jupyter Notebook Skills:
1. Scrape Amazon product pages, read HTML, convert HTML to DataFrames, export to csv
2. Import modules
3. Hard-code variables
4. Create classes to encapsulate script logic
5. Write functions to perform specific tasks
6. Initialize class object and run class functions
7. Write Python code & markdown using Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use the Project:
1. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice on your computer
2. Run Jupyter Notebook in browser
3. Navigate to the cloned project and open "Amazon_Web_Scraper.ipynb"
4. Run script: Kernel > Restart & Run All
5. See the DataFrames in the last two cells or open the created CSV file to compare results
6. Customize the AutoPageScraper arguments as desired
