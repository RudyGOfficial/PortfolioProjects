# Python & Jupyter Notebook Data Cleaning Project
A marketing agency has a raw dataset of customers and needs the dataset to be cleaned and filtered for customers who can be called.

As the Data Analyst, I am tasked to use Python's Pandas library and its functions to clean & filter the table on memory (i.e.: DataFrames). The resulting product will be a table containing customer information of those the agency can contact.

This script works for Windows only.

## This Project Demonstrates the Following Python & Jupyter Notebook Skills:
1. Clean data using DataFrames and Pandas functions
2. Drop duplicate rows, remove useless columns, standardize value formatting, conduct filtering

## How to Use the Project:
1. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice on your computer
2. Run Jupyter Notebook in browser
3. Navigate to the cloned project and open "Data_Cleaning.ipynb"
4. Run script: Kernel > Restart & Run All
5. Scroll down to see section 3 for BEFORE & AFTER
